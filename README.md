## 📌 Key Insights

- Younger passengers had higher survival rates.
- Females had a significantly higher chance of survival.
- Higher-class (Pclass 1) passengers survived more.
- Fare is positively skewed with many low-fare passengers.
- Strong correlation between:
  - `Pclass` & `Fare` (negative)
  - `SibSp` & `Parch` (family groups)
